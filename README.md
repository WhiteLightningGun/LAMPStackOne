As is often the case in any creative endeavour one starts with the simplest, smallest possible thing you can do and bootstrap up from there. In this case - a todo list. Technically, it just barely meets the criteria for being a full-stack app which uses Python and SQLite on the backend with a React client on the frontend. It could be simpler, but not much. The most interesting thing about this experiment was using websockets for instant updates for any computer in the network accessing this web-app. I had no idea it could be so simple.

It was gruelling but fun to get this app hosted on an Apache linux server with a cheap laptop and available on my local wi-fi network. Speaking of which, this app is essentially a toy, as it has no security, and can only be deployed to any effect on a network with a few users.

This was a very personal "proof of concept" for me regarding Python and Flask. It is easy to be blas√© about Python, but there is no denying it's cross platform convenience and speed to build with. 

I'll look back on this project in a few years and probably see it as a massive watershed moment for myself.
