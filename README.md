It was gruelling but fun to get this app hosted on an Apache linux server with a cheap laptop and available on my local wi-fi network. Speaking of which, this app is essentially a toy, as it has no security, and can only be deployed to any effect on a network with a few users. The most interesting thing about this experiment was using websockets for instant updates for any computer in the network accessing this web-app. 

This was a great personal "proof of concept" for me regarding Python and Flask. It is easy to be blas√© about Python, but there is no denying it's cross platform convenience. I'll look back on this project in a few years and probably see it as a massive watershed moment for myself.
