The most interesting thing about this experiment was using websockets for instant upates for any computer in the network accessing this web-app. 

It was gruelling but fun to get this app hosted on an Apache linux server with a cheap laptop and available on the local wi-fi network. I'll look back on this project in a few years and probably see it as a massive watershed moment for me. 

It is easy to be blas√© about Python, but there is no denying it's cross platform convenience.
